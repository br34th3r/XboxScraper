# Xbox Scraper

Use this tool (running somewhere) to allow your computer to automatically detect if the Xbox Series X is back in stock yet.

Current websites supported:
- GAME
- Smyths Toy Superstore

This program will run silently and then open the page if it detects the "OUT OF STOCK" text is missing

Just run with `python main.py` as with other python scripts from your terminal

Only running on macs at the moment, but will make some quick fixes to run on windows shortly.
